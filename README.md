# CarServiceCenter
Car Service Center on Django (JetBrains Academy's project)

This Django project emulates car service center where visitors are queued and served according to a type of service they require. The portal includes client side (choosing type of service, getting position in queue and estimated time) and serviceman side (calling a next visitor).
